Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps.
In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Example 1:
    Input: n = 2
    Output: 2
    Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
    1. 1 step + 1 step
    2. 2 steps

Example 2:
    Input: n = 3
    Output: 3
    Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
    1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
    2. 1 step + 2 steps
